                        thanks to an Internship called next tech and it's not just not because of them teaching me how
                        to code
                        but because of the etiquettes being learned and opportunities that we are being exposed to it's
                        not something
                        that you get on daily basis so yes i am well versed in HTML 5 , JavaScript, CSS, jquery and i
                        hope to expand this
                        collection as i grow,
                        I attend high School in which my sophomore year i took Ap computer Science and in my junior year
